# WeatherUnfold
Project to play about with [Alomofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) as I normaly use URLSession, decodable and also to try out [Ramotion FoldingCell](https://github.com/Ramotion/folding-cell) library. Note: not production app so does have some hard coded properties. Displays current and forecast weather in tableview.
